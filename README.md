# Mendeleev Game
A casual educational 2D Android game. The game aims to help high school students in learning some fundamentals basics of the chemistry subject.

**The Goal:**

This is an old project I did in 2019.

I developed it in three weeks (working three hours per day) to join a local competition for building educational video games. 
And **YES**, I did not win in the competition :ambulance: ,

**but I was so proud that I could build a complete full working game in very limitted time.**

I build it with *Native Android*, using java, android studio, and ***LOVE***. 

**-- note:** 

This little lovely game was designed, developed and published by me alone.
Starting from thinking of an educational game idea,
to skeching some drawings, to reading some chemistry documents, to designing the characters and images in photoshop, to development and beyond that.
